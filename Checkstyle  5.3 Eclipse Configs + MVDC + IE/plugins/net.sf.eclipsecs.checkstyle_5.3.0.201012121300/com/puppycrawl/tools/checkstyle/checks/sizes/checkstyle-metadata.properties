
AnonInnerLength.desc = Checks for long anonymous inner classes.<br/>\r\nRationale: If an anonymous inner class becomes very long it is hard to understand and to see the flow of the method where the class is defined. Therefore long anonymous inner classes should usually be refactored into a named inner class. See also Bloch, Effective Java, p. 93. 
AnonInnerLength.max  = maximum allowable number of lines.
AnonInnerLength.name = Anonymous inner classes lengths

ExecutableStatementCount.desc   = Restricts the number of executable statements to a specified limit
ExecutableStatementCount.max    = Maximum allowed parameters.
ExecutableStatementCount.name   = Executable Statement Size
ExecutableStatementCount.tokens = Tokens to check.

FileLength.desc = Checks for long source files.<br/>\r\nRationale: If a source file becomes very long it is hard to understand. Therefore long classes should usually be refactored into several individual classes that focus on a specific task. 
FileLength.max  = Maximum number of lines allowed.
FileLength.name = Maximum File Length

LineLength.desc          = Checks for long lines.<br/>\r\nRationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy, etc. 
LineLength.ignorePattern = Pattern for lines to ignore.
LineLength.max           = Maximum allowed line length.
LineLength.name          = Maximum Line Length
LineLength.tabWidth      = Number of characters to count for each tab character.
LineLength.IgnoreClass = Check class declaration length.
LineLength.IgnoreConstructor = Check constructor declaration length.
LineLength.IgnoreField = Check field declaration length.
LineLength.IgnoreMethod = Check method declaration length.

MethodLength.countEmpty = whether to count empty lines and single line comments of the form //
MethodLength.desc       = Checks for long methods and constructors.<br/>\r\nRationale: If a method becomes very long it is hard to understand. Therefore long methods should usually be refactored into several individual methods that focus on a specific task. 
MethodLength.max        = Maximum number of lines allowed.
MethodLength.name       = Maximum Method Length
MethodLength.tokens     = Tokens to check.

OuterTypeNumber.desc = Checks for the number of types declared at the outer (or root) level in a file.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nRationale: It is considered good practice to only define one outer type per file. 
OuterTypeNumber.max  = maximum allowable number of outer types
OuterTypeNumber.name = Outer Type Number

ParameterNumber.desc   = Checks the number of parameters of a method or constructor.
ParameterNumber.max    = Maximum allowed parameters.
ParameterNumber.name   = Maximum Parameters
ParameterNumber.tokens = Tokens to check.

Sizes.group = Size Violations

MethodCount.name         = Method Count 
MethodCount.desc         = Checks the number of methods declared in each type.<br/>This includes the number of each scope (private, package, protected and public) as well as an overall total. 
MethodCount.maxTotal     = maximum allowable number of methods at all scope levels
MethodCount.maxPrivate   = maximum allowable number of private methods
MethodCount.maxPackage   = maximum allowable number of package methods
MethodCount.maxProtected = maximum allowable number of protected methods
MethodCount.maxPublic    = maximum allowable number of public methods
