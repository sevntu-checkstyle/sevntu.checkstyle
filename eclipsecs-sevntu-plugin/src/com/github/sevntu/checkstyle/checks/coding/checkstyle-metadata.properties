You can be sure to write any regular expressions for package/imports text filtering.<br><br>Example of usage: to forbid to use "*.dao.*" packages in "*.ui.*" packages, you should use the following regular expressions:<br><br><dl><li>".+.ui..+" as Package name regexp;</li><li>".+.dao..+" as Forbidden imports regexp.</li></dl><br>By means of few instances of this check will be possible to check any number of rules.<br>

OverridableMethodInConstructor.desc = <p>Prevents any calls to overridable methods that are take place in:<ol><li>Any constructor body (verification is always done by default and not configurable).<li>Any method which works same as a constructor: clone() method from Cloneable interface and readObject() method from Serializable interface (you can individually switch on/of these methods verification by changing CheckCloneMethod and CheckReadObjectMethod properties).</li></ol><p>Rationale:<ol><li><q>Constructors must not invoke overridable methods, directly or indirectly.If you violate this rule, program failure will result. The superclass constructor runs before the subclass constructor, so the overriding method in the subclass will be invoked before the subclass constructor has run. If the overriding method depends on any initialization performed by the subclass constructor, the method will not behave as expected.</q><li><q>If you do decide to implement Cloneable or Serializable in a class designed for inheritance, you should be aware that because the clone() and readObject() methods behave a lot like constructors, a similar restriction applies: neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method, directly or indirectly.</q></ol></p><br><p align="right">[Joshua Bloch - Effective Java 2nd Edition,Chapter 4, Item 17]</p><br>

ReturnCountExtended.name=Return Count Check Extended
ReturnCountExtended.desc=Checks that method/ctor "return" literal count is not greater than the given value ("maxReturnCount" property).<br><br>Rationale:<br><br>One return per method is a good practice as its ease understanding of method logic.<br><br>Reasoning is that:<dl><li>It is easier to understand control flow when you know exactly where the method returns.<li>Methods with 2-3 or many "return" statements are much more difficult to understand, debug and refactor.</dl>Setting up the check options will make it to ignore:<ol><li>Methods by name ("ignoreMethodsNames" property). Note, that the "ignoreMethodsNames" property type is NOT regexp: using this property you can list the names of ignored methods separated by comma.</li><li>Methods which linelength less than given value ("linesLimit" property).<li>"return" statements which depth is greater or equal to the given value ("returnDepthLimit" property). There are few supported<br>coding blocks when depth counting: "if-else", "for", "while"/"do-while" and "switch".<li>"Empty" return statements = return statements in void methods and ctors that have not any expression ("ignoreEmptyReturns" property).<li>Return statements, which are located in the top lines of method/ctor (you can specify the count of top method/ctor lines that will be ignored using "rowsToIgnoreCount" property).</ol>So, this is much improved version of the existing <i>Return Count</i> check.<br><br>
ReturnCountExtended.maxReturnCount=maximum allowed number of return statements per method/ctor (1 by default).
